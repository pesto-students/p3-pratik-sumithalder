# Week 5 : JavaScript

## Exercise 5.3

Write a function called hasDuplicate which accepts an array and returns true or false if that arraycontains a duplicate


### Guidelines:
1. Reference

```

hasDuplicate([1,5,-1,4]) // false

const hasDuplicate = arr => new Set(arr).size !== arr.length

```

2. JS function should have Set API implemented
3. Bonus - if space and time complexity is taken care.

## Outcomes:
1. Understanding of Set API and its functionalities.
