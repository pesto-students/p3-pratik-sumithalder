          <p>
          Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India. 
          He was more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great orator and passionate patriot. 
          He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new paradigm. 
          He worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude of the poor and needy, dedicating his all for his country. 
          He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism and established Hinduism as a revered religion on world stage. 
          His message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains relevant especially in the current backdrop of widespread 
          political turmoil around the world. The young monk and his teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his words have 
          become goals of self-improvement especially for the youth of the country. For this very reason, his birthday, 
          January 12, is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India.

          <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
          <p>
          Swami Vivekananda was born in a traditional Bengali family, to father Vishwanath Datta, who was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court 
          and mother Bhuvaneswari Devi, a housewife. From his childhood days, he was interested in spirituality and uses to meditate before 
          the images of Hindu deities. He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.

          In 1871, Swami Vivekananda enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, and studied there till the family 
          moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, he entered Presidency College with first division marks. During college days, Swami Vivekananda 
          founded his interest in various subjects, including religion, philosophy, social science, history, literature and art. 
          He was keen into reading and used to read a lot of Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, 
          the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas.

          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>
          In 1981, Swami Vivekananda became a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramhans. Though he followed him as his guru but was against idol worship, 
          and went ahead in search of real god. After the death of Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda went ahead and founded first Ramakrishna Math in 
          Baranagar in 1886. He vowed to wander like a monk. From 1888 to 1893 he visited many regions of India promoting Hinduism.

          In 1893, Swami Vivekananda got a chance to visit west when the Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at 
          the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the World's Columbian Exposition. There he began his speech with “Sisters and Brothers 
          and of America”, for which he received standing ovation from a crowd of 7000. During his lecture tours in US and UK he actively 
          promoted the ideologies of Vedas and formed Vedanta Society of New York in 1894. Though following his ill health he returned to 
          India and spent his final years here.

          <h2>At the End</h2>
          <p>
          Swami Vivekananda died on 4th July 1902. According to his disciples, Vivekananda went to his room and died while meditating. 
          He attained ‘mahasamādhi’ – a term used by his followers. But the possible cause of death was reported as the rupture of a 
          blood vessel in his brain. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years.

          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>
          Swami Vivekananda revealed to the world the true foundations of India's unity as a nation. He taught how a nation with such 
          a vast diversity can be bound together by a feeling of humanity and brother-hood. Vivekananda emphasized the points of drawbacks 
          of western culture and the contribution of India to overcome those. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose once said: "Swamiji harmonized 
          the East and the West, religion and science, past and present. And that is why he is great. Our countrymen have gained unprecedented 
          self-respect, self-reliance and self-assertion from his teachings." Vivekananda was successful in constructing a virtual bridge 
          between the culture of East and the West. He interpreted the Hindu scriptures, philosophy and the way of life to the Western people. 
          He made them realize that in spite of poverty and backwardness, India had a great contribution to make to world culture. He played a 
          key role in ending India's cultural isolation from the rest of the world.
