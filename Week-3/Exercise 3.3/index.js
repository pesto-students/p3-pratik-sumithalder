// output is Count is 0

// "Count is 0" is logged to console. Increment function has been called 3 times thus value of count is 3. 
// Even if count variable has been incremented a few times, message variable always holds 'Count is 0'. 
// Because, message variable exists within the scope of createIncrement function. Its initial value is 'Count is 0'. However, it always refeact log as 'Count is 0'.
