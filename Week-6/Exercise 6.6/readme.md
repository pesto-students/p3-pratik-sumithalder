# Week 6 : Introduction to DS, Array, Stack and Queue

## Problem 6.6 : 3 sum

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to agiven number, target.Return the sum of the three integers. Assume that there will only beone solution

Example: given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1. The sum that is closest to thetarget is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)

## Assignment Introduction:
1. Calculate the time and space complexity for the set of questions
2. A set of  Problem statement based on array that would help student how toiterate and process an array

## Benchmarks
1. All the problem should have an optimize solutions
2. All the problem statement should have the time and space complexity mention inthe code comment
3. The code should be readable and must follow good coding practice.
4. Keep the code as modular as you can.

## Learning Outcomes:
1. Student will have a good grip on calculating time and space complexity of givenloop or program
2. Students will learn how to iterate and process array
3. Students will learn how to use Two pointer and Kadane Algorithm to optimizecode.
4. Students will be able to solve easy to medium level array problem
