Front-end technologies are sky rocketing in popularity in the last few years. The holy trinity of Front-End - HTML, CSS and JavaScript, are used across different devices and environments - from games, through desktop applications, to robotics. But when we talk about front-end development, one thing always comes to mind first and that is web browsers.

All of us use browsers, but few know how they actually work. We are so used to them, that we take them for granted, but behind every browser lie millions of lines of code. In the next few paragraphs, I will try to show you how exactly browsers work.

Before we start with how a web browser works, let’s have a brief look at the components of a browser that play an important role in its functioning. Post which, we’ll see the step-by-step working of a web browser.
