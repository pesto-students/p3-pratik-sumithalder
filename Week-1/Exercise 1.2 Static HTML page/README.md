# What is all about this assignment

This excercise was to create a static simple HTML page which UI should closely match with the screengrab given as sample. This includes the colors, fonts, icons, text etc. Semantic tags should be used for laying out the UI. There should be one or more Git commits with meaningful commit messages.

So, I have completed this project with the help of HTML and little bit of CSS. And for better practice I have used modern semantic tags for laying out the UI. To achieve or match the screengran given as sample I need to used some external resources as well like:

* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* [icons8](https://icons8.com/)
